        <h1>Your mail deserves <u>privacy</u>.</h1>

        <p>Your email address is your most valuable identifier online. Yet we share the address very loosely and do not think about how often newsletter providers or other companies get hacked.</p>
        <p>If you don't fully trust the developer and are not familiar with a product online, use <b>MailMask</b> to mask your email.</p>

        <form>            
            <input id="mail" placeholder="E-mail" type="email" pattern="[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{1,63}$" required></input>
            <button id="submitButton" class="button-cta"><b>Submit</b></button>
        </form>

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>MailMask creates a unique and random email address for you. This way your real address is kept secret for the website or the app developer. This email address is uniquely fit to reroute incoming mails from the webpage to your address.</p>
        <p>Your MailMask address consists out of a unique id and the domain ending "@mailmask.me".</p>
        <p>Any messages sent to this address by the app or website developer are automatically forwarded to your personal email address.</p>
        <p>MailMask <b>never</b> processes the content of your incoming mails. The data is stored only for forwarding and is deleted after the mail has been sent to your private email address.</p>
        <h2>Can I use this email for all my services?</h2>
        <p>Yes, you can. If you select <i>"Use domain specific forwarding"</i>, MailMask will filter out every incoming emails that are not from the whitelisted domains. If you leave this setting disabled, MailMask will forward every incoming mails to you.</p>
